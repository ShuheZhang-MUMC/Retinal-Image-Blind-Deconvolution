# Luminosity rectified blind Richardson-Lucy deconvolution for single retinal image restoration
This is the MATLAB code for retinal image blind-deconvolution using Luminosity Rectified Blind Richardson-Lucy Deconvolution.
We are happy that this research has been accepted and published on Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine

### USAGE:
Run *demo_main_forAll.m* and select a retinal image from the dataset. The results will be saved in 'results' folder.
User may need to tune the model parameters in order to get better performance.
